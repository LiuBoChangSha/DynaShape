DynaShape is an open-sourced plugin for Dynamo the can be used for constraint-based form finding.

The following dependencies are required to build the source code. They are all available from NuGet
- Math.NET Numerics 3.11
- DynamoVisualProgramming.DynamoCoreNodes 1.2.0
- DynamoVisualProgramming.ZeroTouchLibrary 1.2.0
- DynamoVisualProgramming.WpfUILibrary 1.2.0
- HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX (this package is relatively large, you actually only need HelixToolkit.Wpf.SharpDX.dll)

Alternatively, all the dependent dll files (except Math.NET numerics) can be found in the Dynamo Core main folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.x).
